# ClipB — Product Specification

ClipB is a minimalistic, in-memory clipboard history manager for macOS,
built with Swift + AppKit and zero third-party dependencies.

## 1. Product summary

- Runs as a menu bar app with no Dock icon and no windows (`LSUIElement`).
- Watches the system clipboard and keeps a history of copied text.
- Global hotkey (Cmd+Shift+V) opens a popup menu at the mouse cursor.
- Selecting an entry copies it to the clipboard and pastes it into the
  frontmost app.

### Privacy guarantees (hard requirements)

1. All history lives in memory only. Nothing is ever written to disk.
2. Quitting the app loses all history. This is by design.
3. The app makes zero network connections.
4. It is not a password manager.

## 2. Features

### 2.1 Clipboard monitoring

- Poll `NSPasteboard.changeCount` every 500 ms; read contents only on change.
- Only plain text is captured (images/files are out of scope for v1).
- New values are trimmed of surrounding whitespace. Empty values are ignored.
- Duplicate of an existing entry: move it to the front of the recency order
  instead of adding a second entry. Its obfuscation state is preserved.
- Capacity: 100 entries. When full, the oldest entry is evicted.

### 2.2 Menu bar (tray) menu

- Template (monochrome) clipboard icon; tooltip "Clipboard".
- Menu contents, top to bottom: `Quit`, `Clear`, separator, one row per
  history entry (newest first).
- Entry row title: value truncated to 20 bytes (UTF-8 safe), suffixed
  `... (<N> chars)` when truncated. Tooltip shows the full value —
  except for obfuscated entries, whose tooltip shows the obfuscated title.
- Each entry row has a submenu:
  - `Copy` — copies the full value to the clipboard.
  - `Obfuscate Password` — toggles obfuscation (checkmark reflects state).
  - `Delete` — removes the entry.

Note: AppKit menu items with submenus don't fire a click action, so copy
lives in the submenu. The primary copy flow is the hotkey popup anyway.

### 2.3 Obfuscation

For screen-sharing safety when a password was copied:

- Display: first 4 characters shown, the rest replaced by `*`, capped at
  the row's truncation length.
- The underlying value is untouched — copying still yields the full value.
- Applies everywhere the entry is displayed (tray menu and popup).

### 2.4 Global hotkey popup

- Cmd+Shift+V registered system-wide (Carbon `RegisterEventHotKey`).
- On press: native `NSMenu` popup at `NSEvent.mouseLocation`, entries
  most-recent-first. No-op when the history is empty.
- Popup titles: newlines flattened to spaces, truncated to 60 bytes without
  splitting a character, suffixed `... (<N> chars)` when truncated.
  Obfuscated entries render obfuscated.
- Selecting an entry writes the full value to the clipboard, then simulates
  Cmd+V in the previously focused application.
- Dismissing (Esc / click outside) does nothing.
- Re-entrancy guard: the hotkey is ignored while the popup is open.

### 2.5 Paste simulation and permissions

- Simulated Cmd+V (CGEvent) requires macOS Accessibility permission.
- First run prompts for it (`AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions`).
- Graceful degradation: without the permission the value is still on the
  clipboard — the user pastes manually.

### 2.6 Text handling edge cases

- All clipboard text must round-trip as UTF-8; non-ASCII (diacritics, CJK,
  emoji) must never be mangled. Native `NSPasteboard` guarantees this —
  never shell out to `pbpaste`/`pbcopy`.
- Byte-level truncation must never split a UTF-8 character
  (`Titles.truncateUTF8`, covered by tests).
- NUL bytes and carriage returns are stripped from display titles.

## 3. Non-functional requirements

- Bundle: `ClipB.app`, identifier `com.productmind.clipb`, `LSUIElement = true`.
- Idle footprint: negligible CPU (change-count poll, no content reads),
  a few MB of RAM.
- No crashes on: empty clipboard, huge values, rapid copy bursts,
  concurrent hotkey presses.
- Single instance: on launch, terminate other running instances with the
  same bundle identifier.
- Ad-hoc codesign the bundle so the Accessibility grant survives rebuilds.

## 4. Architecture

Swift + AppKit, SwiftPM executable target, all state on the main thread.

| Concern | Where |
|---|---|
| History model (push/dedupe/evict/obfuscate) | `ClipboardHistory.swift` (pure, tested) |
| Title rendering + UTF-8-safe truncation | `Titles.swift` (pure, tested) |
| Pasteboard polling + writing | `ClipboardWatcher.swift` |
| Global hotkey | `HotKey.swift` (Carbon) |
| Paste simulation + Accessibility | `Paste.swift` |
| Tray menu, popup, wiring | `AppDelegate.swift` |
| Entry point | `main.swift` |

## 5. Acceptance checklist

- [ ] Copy 3 strings → all 3 in tray menu and Cmd+Shift+V popup, newest first.
- [ ] Copy a duplicate → no new row; entry moves to the top.
- [ ] Popup select → value on clipboard; with Accessibility granted it pastes itself.
- [ ] Obfuscate → `abcd****…` in tray and popup; Copy still yields the full value.
- [ ] Copy `Příliš žluťoučký kůň 🐴` → round-trips byte-identical.
- [ ] Clear empties the menu; Quit exits; relaunch starts with empty history.
- [ ] `lsof -i -p <pid>` on the running app shows no network sockets.
